Create a new node item
Check to see if the list is empty, if it is, then insert the new item as the only item in the list
Start at the beginning of the list and move through the list until you reach the end of the list
Set the end node's next pointer to the new node
The new node's next pointer is null (indicating that the new node now is the last node on the list)
Let's say you have an existing linked list like ours shown above, and you want to insert another item, Apple, in the list.
